    "text": "How to remember what you have learned, by Neo Kim:\n\n\n\nAsk: What problem does this solve?\nPreview the architecture: diagrams, key components, data flow.\nUse 3 passes: skim → read → deep dive.\nSplit system into layers: client, routing, server, storage.\nMark material: underline, star insights, write short notes or questions.\nHighlight only 20 percent (don’t mark everything important).\nRead complex topics SLOWLY… the slower the better.\nUse AI to fill knowledge gaps; ask clarifying questions as you read.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Summarize” each topic.\nLearn patterns: Latency + Global: CDN.\nRe-read fundamental concepts if necessary.\nSpaced repetition: review after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month.\nActive recall: use flashcards (e.g., Anki) for key concepts.\nUse mnemonics (SALT: Shard, Add cache, Load balance, Throttle).\nTeach someone else; this forces clarity.\nUse the Feynman technique: explain a concept in kid-level language.\nDraw diagrams to explain flow and concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead to change how you think, not just to learn.\nKeep a notebook for diagrams and daily notes.\nKeep your knowledge system “simple” so you can review it often.\nKeep a daily reading ritual (minimum 25 minutes).\nSleep, move, and rest - your brain needs fuel.\nRead complex topics to expand your capacity for complexity.\nStudy when your mind is strongest (morning or midnight - it depends on you)."
