    <h3>Notes</h3>
    Based on the OSINT framework focused on gathering information from free tools or resources.  The intention is to help people (including myself) find learning resources.  Some of the sites included might require registration or offer more data for $$$, but you should be able to get at least a portion of the available information for no cost.<br>

    <p>I adapted this framework with a learning point of view.</p>
