# Remembering

How to remember what you have learned, by Neo Kim:

## 1 How to Read
* Ask: What problem does this solve?
* Preview the architecture: diagrams, key components, data flow.
* Use 3 passes: skim → read → deep dive.
* Split system into layers: client, routing, server, storage.
* Mark material: underline, star insights, write short notes or questions.
* Highlight only 20 percent (don’t mark everything important).
* Read complex topics SLOWLY… the slower the better.
* Use AI to fill knowledge gaps; ask clarifying questions as you read.

## 2 How to Remember
* “Summarize” each topic.
* Learn patterns: Latency + Global: CDN.
* Re-read fundamental concepts if necessary.
* Spaced repetition: review after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month.
* Active recall: use flashcards (e.g., Anki) for key concepts.
* Use mnemonics (SALT: Shard, Add cache, Load balance, Throttle).
* Teach someone else; this forces clarity.
* Use the Feynman technique: explain a concept in kid-level language.
* Draw diagrams to explain flow and concepts.
  
## 3 Tools, Workflow, and Mindset
* Read to change how you think, not just to learn.
* Keep a notebook for diagrams and daily notes.
* Keep your knowledge system “simple” so you can review it often.
* Keep a daily reading ritual (minimum 25 minutes).
* Sleep, move, and rest - your brain needs fuel.
* Read complex topics to expand your capacity for complexity.
* Study when your mind is strongest (morning or midnight - it depends on you).
